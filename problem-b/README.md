# Problem: JavaScript Fundamentals II

In this exercise, you'll practice with with JavaScript functions, control structures, objects, and basic searching (a la [here](https://infx511.github.io/searching.html)). This problem will also exercise your algorithm design skills!

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments.

You can see the results of your work either by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser and viewing the output in the [Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/), or by running the script directly using Node.js:

```bash
# from the directory for THIS PROBLEM
node js/index.js
```

**A note on testing**: The test suite will execute your `js/index.js` file; any log statements in that script will be shown at the end of the tests.

Also keep in mind that the automated tests are simply to help you verify your results; they will not ensure that your code follows the required syntactical approach.
