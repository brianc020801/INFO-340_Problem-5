# Problem: Functional Looping

In this exercise, you'll practice with functional looping and arrays of objects.

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments.

You can see the results of your work either by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser and viewing the output in the [Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/), or by running the script directly using Node.js:

```bash
# from the directory for THIS PROBLEM
node js/index.js
```

**A note on testing**: The test suite for this problem checks that you have logged the expected output in the expected order. Additional `console.log()` statements (e.g., that you include for debugging) will cause the automated tests to fail and should be removed.

Also keep in mind that the automated tests are simply to help you verify your results; they will not ensure that your code follows the required syntactical approach (e.g., that you used functional programming as required).
